            <a name="morton"></a>I&#8217;ve spent 25 years working on a wide variety of editing projects. These range
            from <b>novels</b> to <b>government reports</b>, from <b>corporate brochures</b> to <b>personal memoirs</b>,
            from <b>business websites</b> to <b>magazine articles</b>, from <b>PhD dissertations</b> to <b>non-fiction
              books</b>, and from <b>organizational publications</b> to <b>blogs</b>.

            <p>If you can write it, I can tidy it up.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>My clients appreciate the fact that I'm prompt, responsive, and focused on meeting all their editing
              needs. I specialize in Plain Language, and my life&#8217;s work is making text more reader-friendly.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>I&#8217;ve been a passionate fan of words, writing, and stories ever since my bookish childhood in
              England. In the decades since then, I&#8217;ve acquired degrees in English Literature and Journalism; and
              I&#8217;ve written several hundreds of articles for various Canadian magazines and newspapers.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>When I&#8217;m not slaving over some problematic piece of copy, I&#8217;m usually to be found (depending
              on the season) swimming in the Ottawa River, kayaking on Meech Lake, cross-country skiing in the Gatineau
              Park, singing folk songs in pubs with other expat Brits&#8212;or just curled up with a good book or film.

                buffing and polishing it before the world saw it.&#8221;</a></p>

                short ones, activated the passives, and made a difficult piece of text much easier to read.&#8221;</a>
