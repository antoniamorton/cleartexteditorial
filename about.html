        <h3>Antonia Morton</h3>

        <p>
          I&#8217;ve spent 25 years working on a wide variety of editing projects. These range
          from <span class="bold">novels</span> to <span class="bold">government reports</span>, from <span class="bold">corporate brochures</span> to <span class="bold">personal memoirs</span>,
          from <span class="bold">business websites</span> to <span class="bold">magazine articles</span>, from <span class="bold">PhD dissertations</span> to <span class="bold">non-fiction
            books</span>, and from <span class="bold">organizational publications</span> to <span class="bold">blogs</span>.
        </p>
        <p>If you can write it, I can tidy it up.</p>
        <p>My clients appreciate the fact that I'm prompt, responsive, and focused on meeting all their editing
          needs. I specialize in Plain Language, and my life&#8217;s work is making text more reader-friendly.</p>
        <p>I&#8217;ve been a passionate fan of words, writing, and stories ever since my bookish childhood in
          England. In the decades since then, I&#8217;ve acquired degrees in English Literature and Journalism; and
          I&#8217;ve written several hundreds of articles for various Canadian magazines and newspapers.</p>
        <p>When I&#8217;m not slaving over some problematic piece of copy, I&#8217;m usually to be found (depending
          on the season) swimming in the Ottawa River, kayaking on Meech Lake, cross-country skiing in the Gatineau
          Park, singing folk songs in pubs with other expat Brits&#8212;or just curled up with a good book or film.
