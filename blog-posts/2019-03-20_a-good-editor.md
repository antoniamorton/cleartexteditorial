# What makes a good editor?

![editor qualities wordle](images/editorqualities.png)

People often think that an editor's main attribute is a predatory passion for pouncing on
errors. There's *some* truth to this; but really, I'm more like a gardener than a hunter. I just
want to root out any weeds or deadwood that choke the vitality of your writing.

Over the quarter-century I've been working on people's text, I've come to believe that these
are the most vital qualities of a good editor.

- A real **passion for language**, formed by being a lifelong reader. I know the difference between good writing and bad writing—and I know how to make yours better.

- The **imagination** to visualize how a document can be improved. Great editors (like me) see not just what IS on the page, but also what's NOT there. I point out things you might have overlooked, which can often be the catalyst for ideas you never knew you had.

- The **language skills** to notice and fix any errors and inconsistencies, and to make your text more actively engaging to your readers.

- Adeptness at both the **macro and micro tasks** of editing. I focus on the bigger picture of your story, and also on all the little details that make for a satisfying reading experience.

- An instinct for **mentoring**: I act as your writing coach, teaching you to be a "self-correcting" author. I point out any ongoing bad habits, so you can fix them yourself.

- A **kindly disposition**: most authors, whether they're successful or beginners, have fragile egos. Any criticism I offer is always constructive.

- The **formal training**. I have degrees in English Literature and Journalism; I've worked for several newspapers and magazines; and I've been a longtime member of the national professional body (now [Editors Canada](https://www.editors.ca)).

- Finally, I'm **quick and efficient** in my work. Most authors aren’t made of money, so I do what I can to help you stretch your editing budget.
