        <h2>What they&#8217;re saying about me</h2>

        <p>The people who hire me come from many different fields, but they have two things in common: they take
          communicating seriously, and they respect their readers.</p>
        <p>All my clients appreciate my help in presenting their material most effectively. Here’s what a few of them
          have to say about my work.</p>
        <h3>A health organization with a report to distribute at a conference</h3>
          <blockquote>
            “Antonia did a stellar job on correcting the English of a very complex research paper, making it much
            more readable. I was particularly impressed by how she tightened the often unwieldy language – and even
            corrected typos in several foreign languages!"
          </blockquote>

              Health</a></p>

          <h3>A best-selling writer with a book about wine</h3>
            <blockquote>
              “In a category of her own is Antonia Morton, who I affectionately call my personal word trainer.
              Antonia has read almost everything I’ve ever written professionally, buffing and polishing it before the
              world saw it."

            <h3>A government department with a report to be rewritten in Plain Language</h3>
              <blockquote>
                <p>“I was highly impressed by Antonia’s ability to rewrite an impenetrable document. She untangled
                  convoluted sentences, cut repetition, replaced long words with short ones, activated the passives, and
                  made a difficult piece of text much easier to read."</p>

              <h3>A professional organization with a website relaunch</h3>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>“Antonia’s experience was a great help to us. Her approach was very reader-friendly; and she posed
                    the questions we needed, to make sure our information was as clear as possible."</p>

                <h3>A major publisher with a non-fiction book to be proofread</h3>
                  <blockquote>
                    <p>“This was tremendously helpful. You made some great saves, and I found your corrections and notes
                      spot-on. It was great to work with you – thanks for catching all those picky little details!"</p>

                    <h3>A glossy magazine with a feature story by an inexperienced writer</h3>
                      <blockquote>
                        <p>“Antonia has the scrupulous eye and keen sensibility essential to a first-rate copy editor.
                          We call her our ‘word goddess.’ She truly works wonders, and has a fast turnaround time as
                          well."</p>

                        <blockquote>
                          <p>“I can dash off an article in an hour, but I really don’t want to spend time cleaning it
                            up. Antonia takes the task off my hands, doing a way better job than I ever could. That
                            makes me more productive."</p>

                            <p>“Antonia’s work is exceptional. It’s worth many times more than she charges. Her power of
                              thought, her way with words, and her tireless efforts are all truly impressive."</p>

                                <p>“My draft manual was long, and it needed a good edit before a tight deadline. Antonia
                                  worked hard to produce a clear, concise, and well-presented document. It looked great,
                                  and I was able to submit it on time."</p>
