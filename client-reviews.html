        <h2>What they&#8217;re saying about me</h2>

        <p>The people who hire me come from many different fields, but they have two things in common: they take
          communicating seriously, and they respect their readers.</p>
        <p>All my clients appreciate my help in presenting their material most effectively. Here&rsquo;s what a few of them
          have to say about my work.</p>
        <h3>A health organization with a report to distribute at a conference</h3>
          <blockquote>
            &ldquo;Antonia did a stellar job on correcting the English of a very complex research paper, making it much
            more readable. I was particularly impressed by how she tightened the often unwieldy language – and even
            corrected typos in several foreign languages!&rdquo;
          </blockquote>

          <h3>A best-selling writer with a book about wine</h3>
            <blockquote>
              &ldquo;In a category of her own is Antonia Morton, who I affectionately call my personal word trainer.
              Antonia has read almost everything I&rsquo;ve ever written professionally, buffing and polishing it before the
              world saw it.&rdquo;

            <h3>A government department with a report to be rewritten in Plain Language</h3>
              <blockquote>
                <p>&ldquo;I was highly impressed by Antonia&rsquo;s ability to rewrite an impenetrable document. She untangled
                  convoluted sentences, cut repetition, replaced long words with short ones, activated the passives, and
                  made a difficult piece of text much easier to read.&rdquo;</p>

              <h3>A professional organization with a website relaunch</h3>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>&ldquo;Antonia&rsquo;s experience was a great help to us. Her approach was very reader-friendly; and she posed
                    the questions we needed, to make sure our information was as clear as possible.&rdquo;</p>

                <h3>A major publisher with a non-fiction book to be proofread</h3>
                  <blockquote>
                    <p>&ldquo;This was tremendously helpful. You made some great saves, and I found your corrections and notes
                      spot-on. It was great to work with you – thanks for catching all those picky little details!&rdquo;</p>

                    <h3>A glossy magazine with a feature story by an inexperienced writer</h3>
                      <blockquote>
                        <p>&ldquo;Antonia has the scrupulous eye and keen sensibility essential to a first-rate copy editor.
                          We call her our &rsquo;word goddess.&lsquo; She truly works wonders, and has a fast turnaround time as
                          well.&rdquo;</p>

                      <h3>A financial guru with a newsletter for his clients</h3>
                        <blockquote>
                          <p>&ldquo;I can dash off an article in an hour, but I really don&rsquo;t want to spend time cleaning it
                            up. Antonia takes the task off my hands, doing a way better job than I ever could. That
                            makes me more productive.&rdquo;</p>

                        <h3>A communication professional with a small website to launch</h3>
                          <blockquote>
                            <p>&ldquo;Antonia&rsquo;s work is exceptional. It&rsquo;s worth many times more than she charges. Her power of
                              thought, her way with words, and her tireless efforts are all truly impressive.&rdquo;</p>

                              <p>&ldquo;Antonia is a terrific editor. She&rsquo;s extremely accurate, and has the wonderful knack of
                                being able to say the same thing in fewer – and better – words.&rdquo;</p>

                              <blockquote>
                                <p>&ldquo;My draft manual was long, and it needed a good edit before a tight deadline. Antonia
                                  worked hard to produce a clear, concise, and well-presented document. It looked great,
                                  and I was able to submit it on time.&rdquo;</p>
