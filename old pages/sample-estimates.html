            	<h2>Sample Estimates</h2>
        <h3>How much does editing cost? </h3>
        
                <p>Here are some quotes for typical projects, giving the tasks, the time (in “pages per hour,” or pph), and the rates.</p>


<p><strong>Client A </strong>is a professional organization that’s relaunching its website. The new text is based partly on the former version of the site, and partly on rewrites by several association members. The document needs to be extensively rewritten to catch all the errors; to create a “common look and feel” for the writing; to weed out any repetition between pages; and to ensure that the material is arranged in the most effective way.<br>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Estimate:</strong><br>
	10,000 words / 250 = 40 standard pages<br>
    40 pages / 4 pph = 10 hours<br>
    10 hours x $75 (corporate rate) = $750 basic project cost<br>
    $750 + (10% for final review, $75) = <strong>$825 total</strong> (plus HST).<br>
    
    
  </p>
</blockquote>

<br>


<p><strong>Client B </strong>is a small independent publishing house with a non-fiction book by one of its regular writers. The in-house editor has already substantively edited the manuscript, and now wants to have it proofread to catch any errors.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Estimate:</strong><br>
	25,000 words / 250 = 100 standard pages<br>
    100 pages / 10 pph = 10 hours<br>
    110 hours x $40 (small-business rate) = $400 basic project cost<br>
    $400 + (10% for final review, $40) = <strong>$440 total</strong> (plus HST).<br>
	</p>
</blockquote>


<br>


<p><strong>Client C </strong>is a government department with an annual report on its spending and activities. The report is stitched together from contributions by a dozen people – so the writing style and formatting are different for almost every section, and need to be standardized. There are also many tables, charts and graphs, which the project manager wants tidied up so the document can go straight to the printer after editing.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Estimate:</strong><br>
	40,000 words / 250 = 160 standard pages<br>
    160 pages / 2 pph = 80 hours<br>
    80 hours x $60 (government rate) = $4,800 basic project cost<br>
    $4,800 + (10% for final review & corrections, $480) = <strong>$5,280 total</strong> (plus HST).<br>
	</p>
</blockquote>


<br>


<p><strong>Client D </strong>is a writer of young-adult fiction, just finishing her second book. She wants her story copy edited to catch any errors in spelling, grammar, punctuation or syntax; and she also wants the editor to flag any places where the characters’ voices alter, or where the plot still needs work.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Estimate:</strong><br>
  75,000 words / 250 = 300 standard pages<br>
    300 pages / 6 pph = 50 hours<br>
    50 hours x $50 (professional writer rate) = $2,500 basic project cost<br>
    $2,500 + (10% for final review, $250) = <strong>$2,750 tota</strong>l (plus HST).<br>
    
  </p>
</blockquote>


<br>


<p><strong>Client E </strong>is the owner of a small business, with a short brochure outlining his services. He plans to distribute it to potential clients, and also to use some of the material for his website. Before he does either, he wants to have the text checked for any obvious errors.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Estimate:</strong><br>
  	500 words / 250 = 2 standard pages<br>
    2 pages / 2 pph = 1 hour<br>
    1 hour x $60 (“express edit” rate) = $60 basic project cost<br>
    $60 + (10% for final review, $6) = <strong>$66 total</strong> (plus tax).<br>
    
    
  </p>
</blockquote>

<br><p>As you can see, that’s a wide range of costs for different kinds and lengths of documents, and different client needs.</p>
