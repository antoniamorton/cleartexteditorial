      <h2>Writing for Clarity</h2>

      <p>Want to write text that&rsquo;s clear, concise, and easy for audiences to understand?</p>

      <p>Originally designed for government staff, this interactive workshop is equally useful for 
        corporations, associations, agencies, and any other group that values clarity in its communications.</p>

      <p>The three independent modules are:</p>

      <ul class="no-style">
        <li>
          Writing for Clarity 1: Declutter your message
        </li>

        <li>
          Writing for Clarity 2: Activate your text
        </li>

        <li>
          Writing for Clarity 3: Organize your ideas
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Each module takes about three hours to deliver, to groups of 8&ndash;15 participants.</p>

      <h2>Take your text from &ldquo;dull&rdquo; to &ldquo;dynamic&rdquo;</h2>

      <p>As a professional editor, I&rsquo;ve spent several decades helping writers to
        improve their text.<br>
      In this course, pen-and-paper exercises help people to practise their new skills &mdash; such as how to:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>avoid needlessly wordy phrases</li>
        <li>cull repetition, redundancy and deadwood from sentences</li>
        <li>use verbs instead of nouns, to give text more energy</li>
        <li>eliminate the passive voice</li>
        <li>give every paragraph a clear identity</li>
        <li>craft a strong introduction and conclusion.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Yoga for Your Story</h2>

      <p>Become a better writer in just a few weeks!</p>
      <p>My interactive course teaches you some of the strategies used by professional fiction<br>
        editors &mdash; such as how to:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>lead with strength</li>
        <li>think about what motivates your characters</li>
        <li>visualize your scenes from a reader&rsquo;s perspective</li>
        <li>use verbs to make your text more vigorous</li>
        <li>map your narrative arc</li>
        <li>develop an ear for dialogue</li>
        <li>avoid the most common writing mistakes</li>
        <li>make sure that every word tells.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Improve your writing skills</h2>
      
      <p>My goal is for you to leave every meeting with your head full of new ideas.</p>
      <p>Sessions are flexible in terms of content, tailored to the individual needs of the authors.</p> 
        In each session, you&rsquo;ll do some or all of these things:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>analyze a piece of your own writing, and a piece by other group members</li>
        <li>discuss the specific problems you have with your work</li>
        <li>write some new material</li>
        <li>practise the writing techniques I&rsquo;ll show you</li>
        <li>talk about your passion for (and frustration with!) the writing life.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The group meets for three hours in the evening, once a week, for a six-week period.<br>
        The time and place are arranged to suit the convenience of participants.</p>
