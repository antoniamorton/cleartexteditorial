      <h2>&ldquo;Writing for Clarity&rdquo; modules</h2>

      <img class="page_image" src="images/2pillars.jpg" alt="Three marble pillars with the words declutter, activate, organize written across the front">

      <p>In this workshop, you’ll learn about the three pillars of effective writing:<br>
        Decluttering, Activating, and Organizing.</p>

      <ul class="no-style">
        <li>
          <span class="bold">Writing for Clarity 1:</span> Declutter your message
        </li>

        <li>
          <span class="bold">Writing for Clarity 2:</span> Activate your text
        </li>

        <li>
          <span class="bold">Writing for Clarity 3:</span> Organize your ideas
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>These basic strategies will help you learn to write text that&rsquo;s concise, clear, and easy for your audience to understand.</p>

      <p>Once you master the techniques, you can apply your new skills to creating all kinds of reader-friendly content.</p>

      <p class="bold">From &ldquo;dull&rdquo; to &ldquo;dynamic&rdquo;</p>

      <p>As a professional editor, I&rsquo;ve spent several decades helping writers to improve their text.<br>
        Now you can learn my secrets—such as how to:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>cull repetition, redundancy and deadwood from your sentences</li>
        <li>use language more concisely</li>
        <li>avoid needlessly wordy phrases</li>
        <li>use verbs instead of nouns, to give your text more energy</li>
        <li>eliminate the passive voice</li>
        <li>give every paragraph a clear identity</li>
        <li>craft a strong introduction and conclusion.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Originally designed for government employees, this interactive course consists of three
          independent modules, each best delivered in a three-hour block of time. Pen-and-paper
          exercises give participants hands-on practice at how to be a better writer.</p>
