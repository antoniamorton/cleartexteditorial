        <h3>Editing support you can trust</h3>
        
      <p>At your publishing house, you want to work with freelancers who are as good at their jobs as your in-house editors.</p>
      <p>I’m Antonia Morton, the book specialist. My goal is to make your life easier by doing just the same competent work you’d do yourself.</p>
            <p>I treat your writers with the right kind of “tough love” – encouraging them with one hand, and with the other helping them to improve their books. I’m experienced at evaluating manuscripts, and giving authors a fix list of how to improve them.

      <h4><a name="fictonornonfiction"></a>Fiction or non-fiction</h4>
      <p><strong>If your publishing focus is non-fiction:</strong> I’m a competent generalist, with a wide knowledge of many different subjects –  gained from decades of dedicated reading in various fields, plus two decades of working as a freelance journalist. </p>
      <p>My main areas of expertise are lifestyles, the arts, and the “soft” sciences: psychology, sociology, history, literature, etc. I’ve edited material on topics as diverse as wine-making, personal finance, self-help, nursing practices, restaurant reviews, alcoholism, linguistics, media awareness, human evolution, military history, geopolitics, women’s issues, and travel. I’m a quick learner, able to tackle most subjects.</p>
      <p><strong>If your focus is fiction: </strong>Having spent my leisure hours immersed in books for almost half a century, I have a keen literary sensibility. And from my work with authors, I know how to suggest improvements to vital story-telling elements such as narrative voice, pacing, flow, dialogue, characterization, psychological development, motivation, plausibility, exposition, point of view, structure, story arc, writing style, imagery, consistency, word use, and so on.</p>
      <p>I’m also adept at preparing critiques for authors, giving them the guidance they need to turn a rough draft into a page-turner.</p>
      <p>(To learn more about my work with fiction writers, visit <a href="http://www.the-story-studio.com/">The Story Studio</a>.) </p><br>
      
            <h4><a name="selectedediting"></a>Selected projects</h4>
      <p>My most recent book edits (early 2013) are two fiction manuscripts (one a fantasy, one a contemporary romance) by young first-time authors; a volume of personal memoirs by a retired teacher; and a self-help book by a leadership consultant. The fiction edits are still ongoing; the other two authors are in the process of self-publishing their books.</p>
      <p>Some other books I’ve worked on:</p>
      
     <p> <ul>
  
<li>Proofread the manuscript of <em>The White Bicycle</em>   (Red Deer Press, 2012), by Beverley Brenna.</li>
<li>Intensively edited wine writer Natalie MacLean’s first book, <em>Red, White and Drunk All Over</em>  (Bloomsbury, 2006), and her second, <em>Unquenchable</em>  (Doubleday, 2011). As her longtime editor, I’ve also helped Natalie to win several international awards for her essays and feature stories.</li>
<li>Substantively edited a personal memoir titled <em>Jackie: A Niagara Falls Boyhood</em>, by John Tammela (as yet unpublished, 2012).</li>
<li>Edited the first draft of <em>Termcraft: The Emergence of Terminology Science From the Sumerians to Aristotle</em>, by Jean Lambert (self-published, 2011).</li>
<li>Edited the first draft of <em>The Copperjar System: Your Blueprint for Financial Fitness</em>, by Alan MacDonald and Paul LaBarge (Copperjar Group, 2010)</li>
<li>Substantively edited the original manuscript of <em>The Descent of Religion</em>, by Liz Carr-Harris (Greyfox Publishing, 2010).</li>
<li>Proofread the first edition of <em>Capital Dining</em>, a compilation of Anne DesBrisay’s restaurant reviews for the <em>Ottawa Citizen</em>  (ECW Press, 2004).</li>
<li>Substantively edited a volume of personal memoirs produced by the Department of National Defence, titled <em>Equal To The Challenge: An Anthology of Women’s Experiences During WWII</em>  (Queen’s Printer, 2000). </li>
